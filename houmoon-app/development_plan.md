## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Project Setup | 1 day | Project structure, dependencies, configuration |
| Core UI Components | 3 days | Design system, base components, enhanced components |
| Authentication System | 2 days | Firebase integration, auth screens, auth context |
| Onboarding Experience | 2 days | Onboarding flow, user profile setup |
| Heart Law System | 4 days | Philosophy feed, wisdom detail, emotional check-in |
| Offline Support | 2 days | Content caching, error handling, fallbacks |
| Testing and QA | 3 days | Unit tests, integration tests, performance optimization |
| Deployment Prep | 1 day | Build configuration, CI/CD setup |

**Total Duration: 18 days**

## Development Approach

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript for all components and functions
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Consistent naming conventions
- Component-driven development
- Test-driven development where appropriate

### Performance Considerations
- Memoization for expensive computations
- Virtualized lists for long scrolling content
- Lazy loading for screens and components
- Image optimization
- Animation performance optimization

### Accessibility Standards
- Semantic HTML structure
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast requirements

## Next Steps

1. Initialize the React Native project
2. Set up the project structure
3. Implement the design system
4. Create base UI components
5. Begin Firebase integration

This development plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the Houmoon app's Heart Law System as the Phase 1 MVP. The structured approach ensures high-quality code, optimal user experience, and a solid foundation for future expansion to include the Practice System, Energy System, and Future Self Dialogue System in subsequent phases.
